Git!
 

Two Big approaches:

Git from the CMD line: Powerful, flexible, irritating
Git from Rstudio: Simple, easy, limiting
Two Secondary approaches:

Working on MASTER branch all the time
Working with Branches
Today we are ignoring branches to keep the workflow simple.

 

Workflow
First day of work:

git clone repo-loc
Make New file:

git add file-name
Before Work:

git pull
After Work:

git commit -m " a-message "
git push
Confused:

git status
Other:

git del
git checkout
git commit -am " a-message "
git commit -am 'a'; git push

Breakout Session
Everyone should have set up thier github repo while doing the async coursework. In each group pick someone to be Student A, and that person will clone Student B's repo. Student B will give collaborator access to Student A using Github and Student A should add a single file and push it back up to Student B.
